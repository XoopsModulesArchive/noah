How to install No-Ah 0.8.7
-------------------------------------

=======
1 - Overview

No-Ah is a php/mysql module built to support the Xoops OO portal system. No-Ah lets you turn any table in the xoops database into a piece of manageable content group by storing metadata about your information and how it is organized. No-Ah then provides many ways to access your content along with the metadata which defines how it needs to be displayed and managed.

Making use of the No-Ah API a module developer can quickly decrease their time to build modules and also the developer who is just getting started can easily create dynamic content with very little php.
